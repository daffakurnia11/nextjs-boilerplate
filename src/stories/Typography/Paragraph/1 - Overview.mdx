`}
/>

The `Typography` component is only imported once, without specify which variant of the typography that want to use. You can specify the `size` prop to determine which heading size you want (`base` and `sm`) and also `as` prop to determine the HTML tag that fits to the application.

<Source code={`
import Typography from "@/components/Typography";

export const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <Typography.Paragraph level="base" as="p">
      This is a paragraph text with the default size
    </Typography.Paragraph>
    // Other content
  </div>
);
`} />
