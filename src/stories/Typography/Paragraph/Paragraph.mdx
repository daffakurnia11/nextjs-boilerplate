# Paragraph Typography

The `Paragraph` component enriches your application's typography by blending uniformity with versatility. Designed for body text, it also embraces `<span>` and `<small>` tags to cater to specific styling and hierarchical needs. This flexibility ensures seamless integration of varied text elements, maintaining consistency and enhancing readability across your application.

## Usage

The `Paragraph` component can be used to insert text with paragraphy or body text styles into your application. It's crucial for maintaining a semantic and accessible document structure.

```jsx
<Typography.Paragraph
  size="base"
  as="p"
  className="text-black"
  styles={{ textAlign: "center" }}
>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
</Typography.Paragraph>
```

## Default Styling

By default, the `Paragraph` component uses the following styles:

```
font-family: "Poppins", sans-serif;
font-weight: 400;
font-size: 1rem; // 16px
line-height: 140%;
```

These styles are applied to match the size of the paragraph, with `base` being the default size, and `sm` being the small size.

## How to Use the Component

To use the `Paragraph` component, simply import it into your component file based on the group of the component, and then use it like any other React component. In this case, the group of `Paragraph` component is `Typography`. You can specify the `level` prop to determine which text size you want (`base`, and `sm`) and also `as` prop to determine the tag element (`p`, `span`, or `small`):

```jsx
import Typography from "@/components/Typography";

export const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <Typography.Paragraph level="base" as="p">
      This is a paragraph text with the default size
    </Typography.Paragraph>
    // Other content
  </div>
);
```

## Variants

The `Paragraph` component supports various sizes of text, which can be specified using the `size` prop. The available variants are `base` and `sm`.
