# Display Typography

The `Display` component is designed to provide a consistent typography hierarchy across your application. This component generally allows the level of heading from `h1` to `h3`, but it can be changed for flexible usage in different contexts in the various levels of heading (from `h1` to `h6`, or other HTML Tag).

## Usage

The `Display` component can be used to insert text with heading styles into your application with different font family based on the font branding of the application. It's crucial for maintaining a semantic and accessible document structure.

```jsx
<Typography.Display
  size="lg"
  as="h1"
  className="text-black"
  styles={{ textAlign: "center" }}
>
  This is an H1 Display Heading
</Typography.Display>
```

## Default Styling

By default, the `Display` component uses the following styles:

```
font-family: "Merriweather", serif;
font-weight: 700;
font-size: 3rem; // 48px
line-height: 140%;
```

These styles are applied to match the size of the heading, with `lg` being the largest and most prominent, `base` being the default size, and `sm` being the smallest.

## How to Use the Component

To use the `Display` component, simply import it into your component file based on the group of the component, and then use it like any other React component. In this case, the group of `Display` component is `Typography`. You can specify the `size` prop to determine which heading size you want (`lg`, `base`, `sm`) and also `as` prop to determine the hierarchy (from `h1` to `h6`):

```jsx
import Typography from "@/components/Typography";

export const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <Typography.Display size="lg" as="h1">
      This is an H1 Display Heading with large size
    </Typography.Display>
    // Other content
  </div>
);
```

## Variants

The `Display` component supports various sizes of display headings, which can be specified using the `size` prop. The available variants are `lg`, `base`, and `sm`.
