# Display Typography

The `Display` component is designed to provide a consistent typography hierarchy across your application. This component generally allows the level of heading from `h1` to `h3`, but it can be changed for flexible usage in different contexts in the various levels of heading (from `h1` to `h6`, or other HTML Tag).

<Controls />

## Basic Usage

The `Display` component can be used to insert text with heading styles into your application with different font family based on the font branding of the application. It's crucial for maintaining a semantic and accessible document structure.

<Source
  code={`
<Typography.Display
  size="lg"
  as="h1"
  className="text-black"
  styles={{ textAlign: "center" }}
>
  This is an H1 Display Heading
</Typography.Display>
`}
/>

## How to Use the Component

The `Display` component is extended from `Typography` component, that makes the writing codes are maintainable and clean. The `Typography` component is only imported once, without specify which variant of the typography that want to use. You can specify the `size` prop to determine which heading size you want (`lg`, `base`, `sm`) and also `as` prop to determine the hierarchy (from `h1` to `h6`).

<Source code={`
import Typography from "@/components/Typography";

export const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <Typography.Display size="lg" as="h1">
      This is an H1 Display Heading with large size
    </Typography.Display>
    // Other content
  </div>
);
`} />

## Default Styling

The default styles of the `Display` component contains of the font family of the text by using **Merriweather**, the font weight using `bold`, and `140%` line height.

```css
font-family: "Merriweather", serif;
font-weight: 700;
font-size: 3rem; // 48px for default base size
line-height: 140%;
```

<div style={{ textAlign: "right" }}>
