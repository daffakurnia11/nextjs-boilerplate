<Controls />

## Basic Usage

The `Small` component can be used to insert text with small text styles into your application. It's crucial for maintaining a semantic and accessible document structure.

<Source
  code={`
<Typography.Small
  size="base"
  as="small"
  className="text-black"
  styles={{ textAlign: "center" }}
>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
</Typography.Small>
`}
/>

## How to Use the Component

The `Small` component is extended from `Typography` component, that makes the writing codes are maintainable and clean. The `Typography` component is only imported once, without specify which variant of the typography that want to use. You can specify the `size` prop to determine which heading size you want (`base` and `sm`) and also `as` prop to determine the HTML tag that fits to the application.

<Source code={`
import Typography from "@/components/Typography";

export const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <Typography.Small level="base" as="p">
      This is a small text with the default size
    </Typography.Small>
    // Other content
  </div>
);
`} />

## Default Styling

The default styles of the `Small` component contains of the font family of the text by using **Poppins**, the font weight using `normal`, and `140%` line height.

```css
font-family: "Poppins", sans-serif;
font-weight: 400;
font-size: 0.75rem; // 12px as default size
line-height: 140%;
```
