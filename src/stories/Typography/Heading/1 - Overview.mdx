# Heading Typography

The `Heading` component is designed to provide a consistent typography hierarchy across your application. This component generally allows the level of heading from `h1` to `h6` for flexible usage in different contexts in the various levels of heading.

## Basic Usage

The `Heading` component can be used to insert text with heading styles into your application. It's crucial for maintaining a semantic and accessible document structure.

<Source
  code={`
<Typography.Heading
  level="1"
  as="h1"
  className="text-black"
  styles={{ textAlign: "center" }}
>
  This is an H1 Heading
</Typography.Heading>
`}
/>

## How to Use the Component

The `Heading` component is extended from `Typography` component, that makes the writing codes are maintainable and clean. The `Typography` component is only imported once, without specify which variant of the typography that want to use. You can specify the `level` prop to determine which heading size you want (from `1` to `6`) and also `as` prop to determine the hierarchy (from `h1` to `h6`).

<Source code={`
import Typography from "@/components/Typography";

export const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <Typography.Heading level="1" as="h1">
      This is an H1 Heading with large size
    </Typography.Heading>
    // Other content
  </div>
);
`} />

## Default Styling

The default styles of the `Heading` component contains of the font family of the text by using **Poppins**, the font weight using `semi-bold`, and `140%` line height.

```css
font-family: "Poppins", sans-serif;
font-weight: 600;
font-size: 2rem; // 32px for default level 1 size
line-height: 140%;
```
